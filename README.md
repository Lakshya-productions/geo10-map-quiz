# geo10-map-quiz
Just a little something I decided to make in my free time, mainly for fun, but also to prepare for GEOG10AC map quizzes.
SVGs are manually edited in Illustrator, and the quiz functionality is in JS.

### Bugs/Improvements
Feel free to create an issue for any errors/bugs you see, or any suggestions you may have. Keep in mind that this is still very much a work in progress though.
